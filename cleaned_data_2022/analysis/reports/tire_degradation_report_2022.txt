STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
========================

TIRE STRATEGY INSIGHTS:
-----------------------
• Soft tires: Best for qualifying and short stints (high performance, fast degradation)
• Medium tires: Optimal balance for most race conditions
• Hard tires: Long stint specialists, consistent performance
• Weather tires: Use intermediate for damp conditions, wet for heavy rain

RACE STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
-----------------------------
• Monitor tire age closely - degradation accelerates after optimal stint length
• Consider track temperature effects on tire degradation
• Plan pit stops based on compound-specific degradation rates
• Use tire degradation data for real-time strategy adjustments

SETUP OPTIMIZATION:
------------------
• Teams with better tire management show more consistent degradation patterns
• Focus on car setup that minimizes tire stress
• Driver training on tire conservation techniques
• Real-time tire temperature monitoring

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
-----------------------
✅ Comprehensive tire age data available
✅ Multiple compounds analyzed across all circuits
✅ Strong statistical correlations found (r > 0.5 for most compounds)
✅ Large sample sizes for reliable analysis

TECHNICAL NOTES:
---------------
• Degradation rates calculated using linear regression on tire age vs lap time
• Outliers filtered using statistical methods
• Circuit-specific effects considered in analysis
• Weather conditions factored into degradation models
